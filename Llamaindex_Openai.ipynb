When Filch wa sn’t guarding the scene of the \\ncrime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out \\nat unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for \\nthings like “breat hing loudly” and “looking happy.” \\nGinny Weasley seemed very distur bed by Mrs. Norris’s fate. Ac-\\ncording to Ron, she was a great cat lover. \\n“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron told her \\nbracingly. “Honestly, we’re much  better off without her.” Ginny’s \\nlip trembled. “Stuff like this doe sn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” \\nRon assured her. “They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have \\nhim out of here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify Filch \\nbefore he’s expelled. I’m only joking —” Ron added hastily as \\nGinny blanched. \\nThe attack had also had an effe ct on Hermione. It was quite \\nusual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now \\ndoing almost nothing else. Nor co uld Harry and Ron get much re-\\nsponse from her when they asked what she was up to, and not un-til the following Wednesday did they find out. \\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made \\nhim stay behind to scrape tubewo rms off the desks.
